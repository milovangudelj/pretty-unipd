# Pretty Unipd

A graphic enhancement for some of the pages of the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Padua. [Elearning DEI](https://elearning.dei.unipd.it)

# How-to

1. Add the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension to your browser
2. When done, click on the icon that pops up in the top right corner of the window
3. Click on `Dashboard`
4. Then go to `Utilities` and paste this link (<https://upo.milovangudelj.com/inject.js>) in the `Install from URL` field
5. Then click on `Install`, and voil√†. The next time you visit those pages you will be greeted with a different, fancier UI.

# But...

1. For the login page only the email and password method works, I have not yet hooked up the 'Login with SPID' button.
2. I recommend you use Chrome or a Chromium based (e.g. Brave) browser since it's the one I used to test and make the scripts (I don't have the time and energy to adapt it or integrate Babel and all that stuff)
